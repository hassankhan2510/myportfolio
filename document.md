4. ABOUT SECTION (CUSTOM-WRITTEN FOR YOU)
About Hassan Khan

I build AI-powered systems that are meant to be used — not just demonstrated.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, automation, and software engineering. I focus on designing systems that can reason, integrate with real platforms, handle failure, and scale beyond prototypes.

I’m particularly interested in AI agents, workflow automation, and LLM-driven systems that interact with real interfaces, APIs, and data sources. Instead of isolated models, I build end-to-end systems: from data ingestion and decision logic to deployment and observability.

My approach is practical by default. If a system cannot run reliably, scale predictably, or solve a real operational problem, it doesn’t matter how impressive the model is.

Global Truck Tire — Production Business Website & Ordering System

Role: Senior Full-Stack Architect
Stack: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, PHP (API), MySQL
Constraint: Shared Hosting (No Node.js backend)

Summary:
Architected and built a production-ready tire shop platform under strict hosting constraints, using PHP as the backend API and React for the frontend.

Key Contributions:

Designed MySQL schema supporting products, discounts, admin auth, and orders

Built a PHP REST API with CORS support for React integration

Dynamic Affinity Scheduling for Web Workers

Role: Researcher & Systems Engineer
Domain: Browser Performance, Web Systems, HCI
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, NUTECH Islamabad

Summary:
Proposed and implemented a human-in-the-loop thread scheduling system for modern web browsers that allows users to manually migrate heavy tasks between Web Workers in real time to reduce UI lag and improve throughput.

Core Idea:
Default browser schedulers act as black boxes optimized for fairness, not interactivity. This research introduces Interactive Scheduling, where users visually monitor worker load and directly control task affinity during execution.

Technical Contributions:

Designed a SharedArrayBuffer-based shared memory architecture for high-frequency coordination

Used Atomics.wait / notify to eliminate busy-waiting and reduce CPU waste

Built a real-time radial heatmap UI for visualizing worker throughput and task affinity

Enabled live task migration between workers without restarting computation

Results:

Achieved up to 127% throughput improvement when migrating stalled tasks to idle workers

Observed transient performance spikes up to 2.7M ops/sec, outperforming static scheduling

Demonstrated that human-in-the-loop scheduling can outperform automatic browser schedulers for short, burst-heavy workloads

Why It Matters:
This work shows that browsers can expose OS-like scheduling controls safely at the application level, enabling better performance for compute-heavy web apps such as video editors, games, and compilers.

Future Direction:
Proposed training an ML model to learn from user migrations and gradually automate affinity decisions without losing human intent.
